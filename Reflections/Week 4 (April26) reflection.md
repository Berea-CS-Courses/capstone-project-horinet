## What have you accomplished this week? (Please list each accomplishment, and explain)
Rebuilt the login screen
Added functionality to the buttons on login/createaccount screens
Updated Android studio 2 times
Researched more on the Firebase database (waiting for the TA tutorial on this)
Imma messaged me about giving me an android device via mail 
I added a comment on the Firebase class to write out what I want the code to do. Currently it does not create accounts or log the user in, hopefully I will get more clarity on that with the tutorial from the TA's/ going to the lab for help. I need to add it to main activity once I understand everything that is going on. 

## What challenges or difficulties did you face? If you solved them, how? If not, what have you learned so far? Have you sought help or other resources?
Android studio updates, however, it made my emulator run faster than it has been so that is a plus. I was sick for the majority of the week and I ignored it until it got too overpowering so I had to take almost a whole day off to rest. I fixed a few errors in the Firebase class to attempt to get a little bit of understanding on what's happening in the code. I have had trouble figuring out back buttons, however I should be able to figure it out once I reorgainize my code. 

## What do you plan to accomplish in the following week? (Please list at least 3 concrete "S.M.A.R.T." goals, along with estimated number of hours to complete, or day to complete)
My goal right now is to just get firebase connected and working. I want to store data, and also have users log in! Hopefully the tutorial will help me from the TA's next week. 
I want to get the reminders set. 
And lastly I want to get my todo/addtask screens working together (this will be an easy fix, I just have to take the time to do that)

## What resources will you use to accomplish your goals for the upcoming week? (please list out the resources)
The same resources as last week (and most likely more)
https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/password-auth?authuser=0
https://firebase.google.com/docs -> In general to find the necessary documents I need to complete my goals :) 
More documents for reminders/notifications for the tasks (most likely notifications route at a specific time set by the user on addtask screen)

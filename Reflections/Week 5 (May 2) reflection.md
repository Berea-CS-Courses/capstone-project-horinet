## What have you accomplished this week? (Please list each accomplishment, and explain)
Rebuilt the login/register account screens again to have functionality. 
ADDED FIREBASE!:
Users are now able to login, logout, create accounts and it is reflective on the firebase console :) 
Users can go back and forth between login and register pages. 
Users stay logged in until they click logout

## What challenges or difficulties did you face? If you solved them, how? If not, what have you learned so far? Have you sought help or other resources?
I went to lab Sunday to get help from Imma. We tried to get the android phone to connect to Android studio (for like an hour), and we did not master it. However, my emulator works perfectly now (knock on wood) and has only crashed once so far (as of Sunday, May 1st)

## What do you plan to accomplish in the following week? (Please list at least 3 concrete "S.M.A.R.T." goals, along with estimated number of hours to complete, or day to complete)


## What resources will you use to accomplish your goals for the upcoming week? (please list out the resources)

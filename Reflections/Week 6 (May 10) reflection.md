## What have you accomplished this week? (Please list each accomplishment, and explain)
Got the tasks to add to firestore, but it doesn't do it right. I've tried but I can't get it working right. I spent a lot of time with the TA's and we tried, but I think Emely found a video that will help me get this and my todo screen finished this weekend. 
## What challenges or difficulties did you face? If you solved them, how? If not, what have you learned so far? Have you sought help or other resources?
Too many to count. Incrementing in Java is not as easy. Storing in firebase is not easy. Android studio kept crashing will I was in the lab trying to get help. I had to close out and restart my emulator. The biggest struggle is passing and updating the counter variable so that it doesn't change to 0 each time the main activity restarts. 
## What do you plan to accomplish in the following week? (Please list at least 3 concrete "S.M.A.R.T." goals, along with estimated number of hours to complete, or day to complete)
Tasks added to firestore CORRECTLY with the counter variable, testing, and showing the tasks on the todo screen. Sadly I don't think this gives me enough time to do 

## What resources will you use to accomplish your goals for the upcoming week? (please list out the resources)

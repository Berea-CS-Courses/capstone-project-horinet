## What have you accomplished this week? (Please list each accomplishment, and explain)
Added Firebase to my app through the build.gradle files
Started on my firebase implementation in Firebaseclass
Finished up the newaddtaskscreen.xml
Commented all of my functions 
There are instructions on how to get to my code labeled "INSTRUCTIONS.MD" that I will update as I continue to add classes, functions etc. 
Built the login screen (need to make changes to that based on feedback from report-out)

## What challenges or difficulties did you face? If you solved them, how? If not, what have you learned so far? Have you sought help or other resources?
Personal challenges, however I worked through them and was able to complete some tasks for my project. My other challenge was mentioned in my report-out. I had trouble adding in all of the imports/implementations/and plugins necessary for Firebase connection to my android studio project. I had a line in the incorrect place of my gradle.build. Emely and Imma helped me out with this problem! I had been looking at the code for so long I didn't notice the issue, so I am really grateful for the help I received. 

## What do you plan to accomplish in the following week? (Please list at least 3 concrete "S.M.A.R.T." goals, along with estimated number of hours to complete, or day to complete)
My goal right now is to just get firebase connected and working. I want to store data, and also have users log in!
I will also make the changes suggested to me in class on Thursday! 


## What resources will you use to accomplish your goals for the upcoming week? (please list out the resources)
The same resources as last week (and most likely more)

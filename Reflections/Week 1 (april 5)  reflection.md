## What have you accomplished this week? (Please list each accomplishment, and explain)
This week I have created the layout for the calendar popup, the mainscreen/homescreen, and added a click listener go from the todo button on the main screen to the todo layout. And as a result of that, I managed to break the Android studio Emulator after one run. However, 

## What challenges or difficulties did you face? If you solved them, how? If not, what have you learned so far? Have you sought help or other resources?
So many challenges with Android studio. Originally, I fixed it by using a different device on the emulator, however that still crashed. So, my solution is going to be using an actual Android device instead of attempting to run this on the emulator. Jess is so kind and we are going to work something out so that I can use one of his old Android phones to run my code on. Hopefully that makes continuing with this process much easier. 
Another challenge was getting the buttons to go the proper screen. I eventually figured it out by just diving in and trying to figure it out, and it worked!! 
The only other thing I Really struggled with was getting the layout to be how I wanted it to be. Adding a new button or anything on the layout screen is a bit of a hassle, each one has to be "constrained" and you have to constrain them both vertically and horizontally or when you run the app they just all show at the top of the screen. Not exactly a challenge, but something I figured out after running my layout the first time. 

## What do you plan to accomplish in the following week? (Please list at least 3 concrete "S.M.A.R.T." goals, along with estimated number of hours to complete, or day to complete)
1. Get an android device to run my app on!! 
2. Work on getting the task popup for when users want to add tasks. (Right now it is only adding a task to a list, however I want it to display with only the task name, but when the user clicks that task I want the screen to popup with the description, due date, est time to complete etc.)
3. Research on how to work in database storage in my app. (Most likely using SQLite, that seems to be the easiest/most convenient way to store the data)
    3.aSubcategory of that one: ^ Figuring out if I really need user log ins, and if I do need them, researching how exactly to implement that. 

## What resources will you use to accomplish your goals for the upcoming week? (please list out the resources)
Overview: google, stack overflow, developer.android, Tutorialspoint.com
https://developer.android.com/guide 
Seems to be the most useful resource I have come across so far. I have used it to understand a lot about Android studio layouts and all of the files! 
https://abhiandroid.com/ui/calendarview 
To help me understand how I can work with my calendar to make it work in the way I want it to!
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/android/android_content_providers.htm 
This website has also been really helpful in just understanding Java code. There are a lot of projects and It seems to be in the results to almost everything I search on Google. 
I will most likely use many more than what I have linked so far, but I wil update that as I go!

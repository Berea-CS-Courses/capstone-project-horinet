## What have you accomplished this week? (Please list each accomplishment, and explain)
1. Got android studio to run the emulator after lots of updates.
2. Added the calendar button to my home screen with a click listener.
3. Tried to figure out colors of buttons and why the emulator and design view aren't the same. (didn't end up figuring it out so I put that on the back burner)
4. Researched a little bit on Firebase to see if I can use that instead of SQlite. 
5. Added half of the "newtaskscreen.xml" which is the todo screen on my Excalidraw file in the prototype deliverable! 

## What challenges or difficulties did you face? If you solved them, how? If not, what have you learned so far? Have you sought help or other resources?
Figuring out the color of buttons, still working on that with Sama and Imma's suggestions. 
Computer issues, that are now solved, however limited my ability to work Monday-Wednesday which was not ideal. Zoom crashed and pretty much crashed my entire computer Monday night-Wednesday night. Of course in turn, that made working on android studio hard, but I was still able to make some progress. I can no longer share my camera on Zoom, it's completely disabled so that my laptop does not crash. That is the only solution Scott and I could figure out, and while it's not ideal for me, it works.

## What do you plan to accomplish in the following week? (Please list at least 3 concrete "S.M.A.R.T." goals, along with estimated number of hours to complete, or day to complete)
Finish my add a task screen, and implement a database. I know that is only two goals, but the database has a lot of sub-goals. I want to have a user log in, then be able to store alllll of their tasks and the attributes with the tasks (start time, end time, reminders (maybe? if that's possible), task name/description)
And if I have time, I will be cleaning up my code (aka making separate classes instead of making it all in the main java class) If not that will be pushed to next week!


## What resources will you use to accomplish your goals for the upcoming week? (please list out the resources)
https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup 
Reaching out to Imma and Emely who have used Firebase if I have any questions once I get started. 
I don't currently have any other resources that I'll be using, but I will most likely be using more and will update this as I do.

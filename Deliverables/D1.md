# Project Specification Statement 
## Overview
Personally, I do not complete my assignments until the last minute, especially now that everything is virtual. However, I am always on my phone, even when I am supposed 
to be completing homework. I want to create a planner app that makes planning assignments and todo lists easier or more effective. This app will include many of the 
features seen in trello as well as apps like Miscrosoft calender or Google calender. This app is meant to be easy to use and personalize the way the user wants to schedule
out their assignments. Through many suggestions this app will include a few different features that I think would be beneficial to help students complete their assignments
on time.

## Concept
* Features of the app:
* Monthly/daily view 
* Users can set daily todo lists 
  * These to do lists will be like the checklists in Trello 
  * Once the user checks something off they will get fun notifications or pop ups like "congrats on completing X assignment/%/hours of work"
* Users can input the due dates for their assignments and how many hours they think this assignment will take
  * (This may be out of scope) The app will then divide up the amount of time/ percent of the project that needs to be completed each day and add that to the calender
    * The app will send reminders for these assignments each day at 8AM by default (similar to the iPhone reminders app)
    
    
    


## Requirements 
An app development software, not exactly sure which app development software I want to use. I would like to be able to see how the app would look on a phone as I am coding
everything out. I am currently doing research on that and will input links as I go.

# Deliverable 0 - Project ideas

**List of Ideas**
I only have one idea for my project. However I want to implement a lot of different ideas into this app.

My project idea is to have this app that replaces your paper planner, but better than that. You set due dates for your assigments, when you want to complete them, what you
need to complete, and once you complete x amount of those tasks you receive a nofication saying "Congratulations you completed x amount of tasks, or x amount of minutes
studying" now reward yourself with *whatever they set as a reward*" Or if you are not getting anything done it will send you a notifcation "This assignment is due tonight]
don't forget." Essentailly this is a very personalized version of Outlook Calender, with a notification/reward system that you can set up. It is not only for unmotivated 
students, but forgetful people as well. This app does not have to be used only for assingments, you can use it for anything you would put in your regular planner as well:
appointments, date nights, or any other plans you have. 

My personal enthusiasm score for this project right now is at a 3. I am super unmotivated to do my work and often wait until the last minute. So if I have an app that will
send me reminders to do my work, and offer me different methods to complete my work, I would be much more motivated. I am hoping that this app will help others, especially 
in this virtual learning setting (which hopefully does not last forever.) My problem with motivation to do my work is that I will write everything down in my notes during 
class that I need to complete. However, I don't write that in my planner, or I forget to look at my planner. Nowadays, everyone has their phone on them at all times, so if 
an app sends you a notifcation that you need to do an assignment, I'm hoping you are more likely to get that done and not forget about it until the last possible moment.

Concerns: 
I have a lot of ideas mashed up into one and I don't know if they will go together as well as I hope. I am having a hard time explaining exactly what I want into words
rather than the image I have in my mind of what I want. So, hopefully after some more discussion I am able to better explain my idea in words that other people will 
be able to understand.

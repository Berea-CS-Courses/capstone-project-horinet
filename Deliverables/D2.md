# Project Decomposition Document 

### What will my app look like?
I am working on getting a visual representation of what my project will look like, I plan to do this on google slides or App inventor.

### Components of my project

* Software required
  * Android Studio
  * Most likely going to code in Java
  * Waiting on resources from Sama for intro to app design class
  * My app will need to have user input/ login and store the data (need to find resources on how to do this in Java) 

* User-interface
  * Calender/ daily view
     * Calender view is month by month view 
     * Daily view is self explanatory, it is a daily view of what the user has planned
       * I want this to have an hourly view
  * Once in this veiw, there will be a tab at the bottom of the screen "to do" which is all of the users tasks to complete today 
         * It is the users preference if they want to input assignments by time, or just the day. 
           * (stretch idea) User will be able to input the due date of an assignment and how many hours they think this assignment will take. The app will then divide the work up to see how many hours the user needs to work on this assignment each day. 
         * This to do list will be similar to the trello check list
         * Once the user checks off an assignment the letters will change to strikethrough format and the user will receive a congratulatory notification for completing it     
  * (Option 2) Next to the "todo" tab will be a "completed" tab that shows all of the tasks that the user has completed. The checked off tasks will move to this tab.

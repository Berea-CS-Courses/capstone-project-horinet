# Project Decomposition Document 

### What will my app look like?
I am working on getting a visual representation of what my project will look like, I plan to do this on google slides or App inventor.



### Components of my project
  * Calender/ daily view
     * Calender view is month by month view 
     * Daily view is slef explanatory, it is a dily view of what the user has planned
         * I want this to have an hourly view
  * Once in this veiw, there will be a tab at the bottom of the screen "to do" which is all of the users tasks to complete today 
         * It is the users preference if they want to input assignments by time, or just the day. 
         * This to do list will be similar to the trello check list
         * Once the user checks off an assignment the letters will change to strikethrough format and the user will receive a congratulatory notification for completing it 
  * (Option 2) Next to the "todo" tab will be a "completed" tab that shows all of the tasks that the user has completed. The checked off tasks will move to this tab

##Sketching Ideas
For now, I will link a google doc with my sketches, once those are final I will embed them into this file :)
I am working on Excalidraw for my sketches as well as a paper prototype that will show user flow!

#Reflection
*How was the process of creating your prototype?
*How did this process guide, clarify, or inform your design process?
*What lingering questions do you have regarding modeling or prototyping?
*How prepared do you feel to start tackling the implementation of the system you have modeled and prototyped?

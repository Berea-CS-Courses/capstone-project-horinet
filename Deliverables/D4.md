The three picures above are the res layout of the todo screen, and what that looks like in the design view.

This code is what shows when the emulator opens, or when the user opens the app. When I committed this, the on create was the todo screen where they can add a task.

This code allows the user to add a task. The read and write methods are for the database that will most likely be changed. I just added them from a tutorial and I'm not sure if I will keep them. 

## Proof of Concept
## Concept documentation
What external software or tools are needed to run your proof-of-concept?
(e.g, general dependencies, build systems, or other frameworks.)
List of what I will need to use to create my app and resources for each one (library/database/data structure ect): 

**Data base:** Mongodb. In order to have users log into an account and save their activities I need to have a database to store their information. https://www.baeldung.com/java-mongodb
User login/create account: https://medium.com/muhamadjalaludin/how-to-create-user-interface-login-register-with-android-studio-34da847b05b2 
Password field in java https://www.javatpoint.com/java-jpasswordfield

**Calendar library:** 
    * I will use the java calendar library to display a calendar. https://abhiandroid.com/ui/calendarview, https://www.w3resource.com/java-exercises/datetime/java-datetime-exercise-2.php, https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html
    
**Notifications:** 
    * Send notifications with user-set times https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23440251/how-to-repeat-notification-daily-on-specific-time-in-android-through-background, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23440251/how-to-repeat-notification-daily-on-specific-time-in-android-through-background, https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/notifications, https://riptutorial.com/android/example/11495/scheduling-notifications
    
**Starting point** 
    *To start out the working prototype I will have the basic todo list in checklist form, and elaborate from there. The code in the repo as of Wed. March 24 is "Basic activity" template from Android studio.  https://www.sitepoint.com/starting-android-development-creating-todo-app/
    
**Scrollable** 
    * Any screen that needs to be scrollable. Using HorizontalScrollView https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/HorizontalScrollView.html 
    
**Dropdown menus/lists** 
    * Might cut this and use JDatePicker and display calendar to choose date, and ___ for time 
    * When adding a task there will be a lot of dropdown lists to select time/date/repeat reminders. So I can do this using JComboBox. https://www.codejava.net/java-se/swing/jcombobox-basic-tutorial-and-examples
    
**Text boxes (within the add a task screen)** 
    * For the task name I can use JText field which allows for a single line text. https://www.javatpoint.com/java-jtextfield 
    * For the Task description I can use JTextArea which allows for multiple line text. https://www.javatpoint.com/java-jtextarea
    * Entering dates via calendar view JDatePicker (it's better to not have user inputs here) https://www.codejava.net/java-se/swing/how-to-use-jdatepicker-to-display-calendar-component
    * Entering time, Via time picker, or within time and date picker (start time, end time, due date, reminder times, etc.) https://vaadin.com/components/vaadin-time-picker/java-examples (this is an eh resource), https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/controls/pickers#TimePicker (this one is better) https://www.journaldev.com/9976/android-date-time-picker-dialog (date and time picker)
    
**Buttons** 
Honestly, this app is probably going to have a **ton** of buttons. 
    * Back buttons, actionlistener with button to go to previous page https://www.javatpoint.com/java-actionlistener, 
    * Calendar button (nearly the same idea as date picker above), just goes to a calendar view where you can add tasks
    * Adding an icon to the buttons (plus signs, hamburger menu (if I add that) http://www.java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0240__Swing/AddingIcontoJButton.htm 
    
**Checklist** 
The best part of finishing a task is checking it off your todolist, so I will do this using a JCheckBox https://www.javatpoint.com/java-jcheckbox

**Other resources**
https://www.sitepoint.com/starting-android-development-creating-todo-app/ and https://guides.codepath.com/android/Basic-Todo-App-Tutorial. https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@ideba/creating-a-todolist-android-application-with-android-achitecture-components-part-1 **ALL** of the code up to this point is from this tutorial and the "empty project" template in Android Studio. 
 
*What steps would need to be taken to run your proof-of-concept?*
	(e.g, run the following command(s) or program(s): ____)
	Android studio took a little bit of time to figure out. I have added by code into this repo under "Todolistproject" In order to run that code I have to open the "Todolistproject" project in a different window in Android studio and run it in that window. It will not run in the "capstone-project-horinet" project window. Other than that all I have to do is hit the run button and it will show in the emulator in a separate window (or on the android device plugged up, however I do not have an android device). Usually this takes anywhere from 30 seconds to around a minute and 30 seconds.

*What is the current functionality of the proof of concept as you have submitted it?*
	(e.g, this prototype displays a ____ that allows a user to ____)
    As of Wednesday March 24th, no "working" prototype yet, but most of the documentation/resources down and lots of youtube videos/ linkedin learning watched! 
    As of Thursday April 1st, I have a working simple todo list app that adds a task with a button. It is not much, but I've spent this entire time trying to get something working. A user is able to add tasks and it shows up on the screen.

*Are there any components of the code or systems you have submitted that you did not create? If so, document them here alongside their source or reference.*
	(e.g, code blocks you might have found on StackOverflow. Code dependencies do not need to be listed here, such as Qt3.)
	Yes. Currently (as of Wednesday night) the code submitted is from an android studio template, I have not changed anything as of 6:49PM, but if I do it will be cited!
	As of Wednesday March 31st, I have used https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@ideba/creating-a-todolist-android-application-with-android-achitecture-components-part-1 to create and understand the prototype.
	Update: April 1st I followed the instructions on https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Basic-Todo-App-Tutorial tocreate the simple to do app. 


## Updates to Previous Deliverables
### D0
Project Idea confined: 
Planner/todo app to make getting through a busy life a little easier. 
Basic summary: Insert tasks, get reminders for them, and get the satisfaction of checking tasks off as you go. 
This will be very similar to a mash-up of Microsoft calendar and trello. Users will be able to input tasks with: 
* Name of task
* Task description
* Start date, end date
* Est. time to complete
* Set a reminder by date, time, and repeat reminder
Users will also be able to input classes. recurring meetings in the same ways and (stretch idea) the app will send notifications based on free time for when to work on assignments. (This will most likely be a last stretch idea if I have time)
There will be a few different "views" to access to do lists. 
    * Just a regular todo list format
    * From that format the user can move into an hourly view to view tasks/classes/meetings in hourly format
    * And lastly a calendar/monthly view (from the calendar button on the "mainscreen" (mainscreen= screen with "todo","upcoming","finished"))
Visual representation is available in D03. 

### D1
Software/ language: Android Studio, Java 
Features of the app available in D03 prototype and the way they will be implemented in D04.
Extras that will be added: 
* Separate sections: To do (that day), Upcoming(probably set this to a week out?), and finished 
    * When user checks off a "To do" task it will move to finished section
* (Last added stretch if I have time)  * User can input their class schedule/ work schedule along with any appointments they have and the app will make note of when the user is busy/ when the user has a break and send reminders to complete tasks they haven't started/completed yet for the day.
Data base to store user login data and tasks to access on a different device (most likely not going to do desktop/website version)
### D2
The visual representation is available in D3 via PDF for user-flow and excalidraw prototypes, and google doc. 
(Relatively same update as D03 update)
Need to add: 
A delete option for tasks 
    * Button within the edit task screen at the bottom 
An easy way to edit tasks 
    * Maybe a pencil button next to the task on the todo list
(Stretch idea) A "plan this task for me" button
    * This will be the algorithm that plans out how many hours to work on an assignment a day based on how long it will take, when the user inputs the assignment and the due date.
### D3
Very few changes need to be made to this deliverable. Mainly, before next friday I need to add a few more components to my prototype, and update the user flow diagram! 
Need to add:

    * Button within the edit task screen at the bottom

    * This will be the algorithm that plans out how many hours to work on an assignment a day based on how long it will take, when the user inputs the assignment and the due date.
Maybe, suggested in class after report out, a hamburger menu to get to the screens easier.
    * Still working out what exactly would be in that menu if I feel it is necessary to add it.

## Reflection 
*How confident do you feel about your project now that you have created a working proof-of-concept?*
Scale of 1-10. I am probably still at a solid 6. There is a big learning curve for me and I am trying to fill that via youtube videos and lots of reading about android studio and app development. 
Update: I am maybe at a 6.5-7 now. I feel much better now that I was able to get Android Studio to work and everything to run properly. 

*Have you faced any significant challenges in the creation of your project so far? If so, what are they?*
Yes. I tried around 5 tutorials. Edited all of the code, added all of the code, tried to understand the code: only for my computer to crash every time I tried to run it, or have very significant errors. So, I gave up for a little bit. Read more articles, more tutorials, watched more youtube videos, and hopefully I will have something to show tomorrow during class time. 
Update: I have had so so many issues. First, the emulator wouldn't work, then every tutorial I found was too out of date to even try to replicate. Second, android studio crashed too many times to count. Third, my patience wore very thin and I almost gave up. Thankfully, I was able to get the todolist working and now I understand (better than before) how android studio works! 

*What do you need from instructors and teaching assistants to better help you implement, understand, or otherwise think about your project?*
Just to be accepting and understanding that I have never created an app before and I'm trying my hardest to understand and implement what I need to for this project, which they all already are! :) I have went through a significant amount of resources so far and plan to continue doing so as I move further along.

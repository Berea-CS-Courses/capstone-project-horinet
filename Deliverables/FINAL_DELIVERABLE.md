I think that I have all of the permissions submitted correctly. Here is a quick recap of all of my apps capabilities: 
- Register/ login/ logout users
    - When user registers it checks to see if email already exists, checks to see if password is at least 6 characters long
    - When user logs in it checks to see if email and password match was is stored in the database, checks to see if the email exists in database!
    - When user logs out it takes them to the login screen.
- From the add task screen, user inputs the information and that is then stored in firebase in the user/userID/tasks/tasksdoc(number of the task here)
- Leads user to the todo list and they can click on the item from the screen and retrieves the data from Firebase and shows it on the screen
- User can exit the screens by clicking the "X" button 
- User can get to the todo screen from the homescreen to see their tasks 
- Pretty design colors :)
- Has a calendar view, that is just essentially a calendar with no other functionality at the moment. 
- A lot of buttons throughout that lead users to different activities in the code, clearly labeled to make life easier. 
- Has all the capability for further improvements: 
    - Deleting tasks, moving them to finished and upcoming screens, setting reminders, and hourly view. All of the necessary components are there, I just wish I had more time (and less computer issues) to implement that functionality.

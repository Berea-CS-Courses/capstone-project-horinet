# Deliverable 0 - Project ideas

**Name:**  

## Instructions

1. Write the list of ideas you've generated (at least 3)

2. For each idea:

- Describe the idea or the problem you want to solve (.e.g. I want to know how much money and polar bears I would save with a vegan diet; It's hard for me to find sheet music for my favorite video game soundtracks;  I want to make a robotic selfie stick that always gets the best angle )

- Describe an envisioned scenario of use or target user(s)

- Describe possible modalities a solution to your idea could take (web, mobile app, wearable, physical). There can be more than one.

- Give the idea a personal enthusiasm score (5: I love it! -- 1: meh)

3. Briefly summarize what your preferred idea is, and why you want to use this as your project. Describe any goals, concerns or challenges you have. We will use this as a starting point for our individual meetings with you next week.

## Submission

Save the document as _"D0 - Ideas.md"_ and submit to your Deliverables folder in (Github)[www.github.com].

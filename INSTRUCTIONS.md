Instructions on how to get to my code:
Go to the Todolistproject folder, 
Go to src folder
Go to main folder
Within java/com/example/todolist is the main activity class right now 
Within res are all of my layouts
And that's all. I have made a few changes in the build.gradle on both the app level and project level to add firebase!

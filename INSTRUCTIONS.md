Instructions on how to get to my code:
Go to the Todolistproject folder, 
Go to src folder
Go to main folder
Within java/com/example/todolist:
MainActivity -> everything I have presented in class as of April 30th
Register.java -> the activity with firebase that registers a user
Login.java -> the activity with firebase that logs in a user if they have an account
addtasks.java -> this is the class that adds the activity to firestore (and creates a new document for each activity to be accessed later)
Within res are all of my layouts/activity layouts
And that's all. I have made a few changes in the build.gradle on both the app level and project level to add firebase!
